            <div class="blurb-text">I wrote my first bit of HTML in the 5th grade, and ever since then, I've been hooked. I started to take web design more seriously in college, and
                graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Western Washington University in 2017.</div>

                <div class="blurb-title">Experience</div>
                <div class="blurb-text">Although I may not have years of professional experience on my resume, I've still accomplished some things. I spent around a year working with a small team to develop a web app for a local politcal party. I did most of the front-end (CSS, HTML, Bootstrap 3) and some of the back-end (Django, Python, SQL). I've also built a couple personal blog sites. 
                    At first they were built in PHP and WordPress, but nowadays Jekyll better fits my needs. I try to make them work on as many devices as possible and prefer media queries over grid frameworks.</div>
